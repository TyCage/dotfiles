#!/usr/bin/expect -f
# Spawn Bash with preset command and arguments
#   by Yu-Jie Lin
#
# Purpose:
#   a) You may want to launch a shell for specific command every time you
#      resume your workflow,
#   b) You still need the interactive shell after you run the command, and
#   c) You don't want to type the command every single time and you may not
#      want to run it at first when you just resum the workflow.
#
# Run with
#   bash-with-cmd command arg1 arg2 arg3...
# You will get like
#   $ command arg1 arg2 arg3 [cursor stop here]"
#
# Alternate:
#   echo "command arg1 arg2 arg3..." >> ~/.bash_history ; bash

spawn bash
expect -re ".*(#|\\$|%|>).*"
